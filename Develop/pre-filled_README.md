# README Generator

## Description 
This project is designed to create a functional and complete README.md file for your projects. No longer do you have to worry about styling and editing your README files. This app allows you to get back to the important things pertaining to your applications. This README you're reading was actually created with this app. (WOW) This app uses the inquirer module from node to ask the user questions about their project and returns to them a pre-filled README. You can always update or edit any information that may change after creating the README file.

## Installation<a name="installation"></a>

First and foremost, you will want to install Node.js on your computer. Once you've installed Node, you'll be able to input your information and see a completed README as a result. I recommend installing the dependencies node.js offers that I've used along with this project as well. (FS & Inquirer) They are two powerful tools that can achieve a lot of great things with your projects.


## Usage<a name="usage"></a>

Although this project was created as a homework assignment, it actually has a lot of practical uses in real-world situations. Professionals can now delegate README file generation to anyone who knows how to answers prompts. Instead of trying to style the file correctly, they can focus on more meaningful and fulfilling tasks.

## Contributing<a name="contributing"></a>

The source code was cloned from Xander Rapstine and I, Curtis Henderson, created functions to implement the code.

## Tests<a name="tests"></a>

It is very easy to test this app out. If you clone the starter code and install Node.js, you'll be able to input your own test information and see a pre-filled README return to you!
